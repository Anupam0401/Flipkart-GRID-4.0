The repo contains our approach and idea to solve Level 2 problem statement (PS 3) in FLipkart GRID 4.0

# Extract Trends from social media data
- As part of this challenge, teams are expected to identify trends from social media data
- From all the products available on Flipkart identify trending products, utilize all signals available (ex. posts, sessions, check-ins, social graphs, media content, etc.). Output should also have photos, videos, gifs which can be
used on Flipkart app.
- Preferred tech: Open source
- Bonus: Signal extraction from multiple social media channels (ex. FB, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)


## Brief Approach
